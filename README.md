# Hi, I'm Ian. 

I'm currently a HKU PhD student, and you can try to find my photo from the [official website](https://saasweb.hku.hk/student/2021phd.php#ianzhang), I think I've given you more than enough hints : p

In the past one year, I have lost over 30 catties of by body weight and you can check these plots
![plots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IanFla/Lose-Weight/main/weight.png)
that shows my past and future body weight : >

I did researches about the asymptotic properties of stochastic dynamic system. There are two publications [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893965918303215) and [that one](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mma.6540). The latter one is much better but people don't cite it : (

I'm currently especially interested in the application of randomness in computation. As a by-product, I made a noval way to [visualization the Markov chains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09850.pdf), check the examples
![examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IanFla/Markov-Chains/main/MC3.png?token=AMHG2XP6WJP5BIP7D5R52HDBJ22Z4)
which are actually 10-chains : ]
