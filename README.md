# Hi, I'm Ian. 

I'm currently a HKU PhD student in Statistics, and you can try to find my photo from the [official website](https://saasweb.hku.hk/student/2021phd.php#ianzhang), I think I've given you more than enough hints : p

In the past one year, I have lost over 30 catties of by body weight and you can check these plots

that shows my past and future body weight : >

When I was a math student in HIT ([Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/)). I did researches about the asymptotic properties of stochastic dynamic systems. There were two publications, [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893965918303215) and [that one](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mma.6540). The latter one is much better but people don't cite it : (

I'm currently especially interested in the application of randomness in computation. As a by-product, I made a novel way to [visualization the Markov chains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09850.pdf), check the examples

![examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IanFla/Markov-Chains/main/MC3.png?token=AMHG2XP6WJP5BIP7D5R52HDBJ22Z4)

which are actually 10-chains : ]

Furthermore, I'm also a tutor of the course [STAT8019 Marketing Analytics](https://github.com/IanFla/Teaching-Experience/blob/main/STAT8019%20Marketing%20Analytics/Tutorial_4__STAT8019.pdf) and the course [STAT6011 Computational Statistics](https://github.com/IanFla/Teaching-Experience/blob/main/STAT6011%20Computational%20Statistics/Tut%202/Tut%202%20(with%20answers).ipynb) in HKU, I have to hold the tutorials with English although I'm not good at speaking English : <

I was also one year in [France](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version) as an exchange student in my fourth undergraduate year, mainly to explore new possibility of my study and life. There was an interesting [Machine Learning project](https://github.com/IanFla/IanFla.github.io/blob/main/files/EMG_based_gesture_recognition.pdf), where you can see my hands. This experience ends up a disaster because of the Covid-19 : \
