# Hi, I'm Ian. 

I just graduated from HKU ([Hong Kong University](https://www.hku.hk/)) with a MPhil in Statistics, and currently seeking for a good PhD program : >

When I was a math student in HIT ([Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/)). I did researches about the asymptotic properties of stochastic dynamic systems. There were two publications, [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893965918303215) and [that one](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mma.6540). The latter one is much better but people don't cite it : (

I'm currently especially interested in designing and improving statistical algorithms for estimation and testing. As a by-product, I made a novel way to [visualization the Markov chains](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09850.pdf), check the examples

which are actually 10-chains : ]

Furthermore, I'm also a tutor of the course [STAT8019 Marketing Analytics](https://github.com/IanFla/Teaching-Experience/tree/main/STAT8019%20Marketing%20Analytics) and the course [STAT6011 Computational Statistics](https://github.com/IanFla/Teaching-Experience/tree/main/STAT6011%20Computational%20Statistics) in HKU, I have to hold the tutorials with English although I'm not very good at speaking it : <

I also had one year in [France](https://www.ec-nantes.fr/english-version) as an exchange student in my fourth undergraduate year, mainly to explore new possibility of my study and life. This experience ends up a disaster because of the Covid-19 : \

PS, if you want to cook something, the eggs and potatoes would be a cheap, quick and delicious choice!
