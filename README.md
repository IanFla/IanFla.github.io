# Hi, I'm Ian. 

I'm currently a HKU PhD student, and you can try to find my photo from the [official website](https://saasweb.hku.hk/student/2021phd.php#ianzhang), I think I've given you more than enough hints. 

In the past one year, I have lost over 30 catties of by body weight and you can check these figures

that shows my past and future body weight.
